Pastebin Domains Center AutoSubmitter
=================

Gosh that name's long. Sheesh.

So this script does what its names says, it uses the list of [top one million sites according to Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and submits them to [Pastebin's domains center](http://pastebin.com/domains).

Why did I make this? I don't know. I was bored one night, and this helped teach me a little Python.
