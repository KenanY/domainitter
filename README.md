# Pastebin Domains Center AutoSubmitter

Gosh that name's long. Sheesh.

So this script does what its name says, it uses the list of [top one million sites according to Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and submits them to [Pastebin's domains center](http://pastebin.com/domains).

Why did I make this? I don't know. I was bored one night, and this helped teach myself a little Python.

## Usage

1. Clone the files: `git clone git://github.com/KenanY/Pastebin-Domains-Center-AutoSubmitter.git`
2. If you want, get an updated list of top 1 million websites by downloading [Alexa's list](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip). You'll need to unzip the archive, then convert the list to a txt file (don't change its name, or you'll break stuff).
3. Run `main.py`  
4. Make a choice of whether you want the script to choose websites randomly to submit, or start from the top sites then work its way down
5. ????
6. PROFIT!! (okay, not really)
